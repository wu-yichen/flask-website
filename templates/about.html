            <h3>lolita fashion</h3>

            <p>Lolita (ロリータ・ファッション, rorīta fasshon) is a fashion subculture from Japan that is highly influenced by
                Victorian and Edwardian children's clothing and styles from the Rococo period. A very
                distinctive property of Lolita fashion is the aesthetic of cuteness. This clothing subculture can be
                categorized into three main substyles: 'gothic', 'classic', and 'sweet'. Many other
                substyles such as 'sailor', 'country', 'hime' (princess), 'ero' (erotic), 'guro' (gore), 'oriental',
                'punk', 'shiro (white)', kuro (black) and steampunk lolita also exist. This style evolved into a widely
                followed subculture in Japan and other countries in the 1990s and 2000s and may have
                waned in Japan as of the 2010s as the fashion became more mainstream.</p>

            <h3>History </h3>

            <p>Although the origin of the fashion is unclear at the end of the 1970s a new movement, known as Otome-kei
                was founded, which slightly influenced Lolita fashion since Otome means maiden and maiden style looks
                like a lesser elaborated Lolita style. Before Otome-kei emerged, there was already a rise of the
                cuteness culture in the earlier seventies; during which there was a high emphasis on cute and childish
                handwriting in Japanese schools. As a result of that the company Sanrio began experimenting
                with cute designs. The cuteness style, known as kawaii style, became popular in the 1980s. After
                Otome-kei, Do-It-Yourself behavior became popular, which led to the emergence of a new style
                called 'doll-kei' the predecessor of Lolita fashion.</p>

            <h3>Popularization </h3>

            <p>People who have popularized the Lolita fashion were Mana and Novala Takemoto. Novala wrote the light
                novel Kamikaze Girls (2002) about the relationship between Momoko, a lolita girl and Ichigo, a
                Yanki. The book was adapted into a movie and a manga in 2004. Novala himself claims
                that "There are no leaders within the lolita world". Mana is a guitarist and is known for
                popularizing of the Gothic Lolita fashion.[5] He played in the band Malice Mizer (1999–2001) and founded
                an own band Moi Dix Mois (2002–present). These bands are categorized under the Visual Kei genre, known
                for their eccentric expressions and elaborate costumes. He founded his own fashion label, known as
                Moi-même-Moitié in 1999, which specializes in Gothic Lolita. They are both very
                interested in the Roccoco period.</p>
